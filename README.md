## 🧠 About

This is a practice-based collaboration between three friends who are passionate about learning web development. We build mini front-end projects together to sharpen our skills and learn through real experience.

The goal is not just to build, but to **practice**, **experiment**, and **grow**.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Netlify** for deployment
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration

No frameworks or libraries — just pure front-end code.

---

We regularly add more projects as we continue learning and collaborating.
